# Dachshund memory game

Classic Memory AKA Match Match, Concentration or Pair card game designed for single-player play.
You must find pairs of cards and you will receive 10 points. The wrong choice subtracts 5 points.

In the options menu, you can change the level of difficulty.

The leitmotif of the game were dachshunds, because why not.

## Installation

Use the [link](https://15megapaskali.github.io/memorygame/) to open browser version.


## Usage

The game can be started directly from github pages.

I encourage you to export yourself to an exe file, I have placed configuration files in the 'export-exe-config' folder.

I don't upload the finished version here because it weighs over 160 MB;)

##Idea

The creation of the game was inspired by the desire to use electron  and electron-package. For a long time, before I started learning programming, I was interested in how to create window applications, which is why I decided to start with it.
On the way to the goal, it turned out that the use of front-end technologies for creating desktop applications is often found.

##Technologies used

The following technologies were used in the games:
1. [electronjs](https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org)
2. [electron-package](https://github.com/electron/electron-packager)
3. SCSS / sass
4. jQuery
5. RWD

everything packed with a webpack.

Pictures are saved in the form of tables and named as 01, 02, 03, etc. You can replace the pictures with any other, just put in the images folder 6-8 selected pictures and name them the same.

##Development

I will try to upload the game as an installer for Windows, Linux and macOS soon

I would like to expand the options menu, expand the image base on playing cards.
Ultimately, I would like to create a new version using Reacta.
